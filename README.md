Coding Exercises
================

**Worki in progress**

Currently refactoring this code to write tests for each challenge. The challenges are going to be empty functions which will fail the test. When the refactoring is completed, the solutions wil exist in a different branch as a reference.

Coding exercises, handy practice for technical interview questions. I will put up my solutions to some popular questions and exercises in this repo, and welcome any feedback or suggestions!

All of the exercises are coded in my favorite language, Clojure.

Most of the exercises are taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview, 4th Edition" by Gayle Laakmann.
